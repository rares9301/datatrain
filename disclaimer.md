<h2>Project Name: datatrain</h2>

<br>
This project is a personal endeavor to bring to life an outlier detection and Z-score calculation system. It is crafted with passion by an independent developer, aiming to explore how data can be cleaned and prepared for analysis.

<h2>
Reliability
</h2>

<b>It's important to remember that while the algorithms are designed to identify and remove extreme or incorrect values, they are not perfect. In our quest to model the world through data, we can sometimes remove information that, though it may appear unusual, is in fact essential. This is even truer for small-scale projects, where resources and data are limited.</b>

Each use of this project is its own journey and comes with the responsibility to critically evaluate the results. As a developer, I take responsibility for the code written, but I cannot guarantee that the outcomes will always align with every user's expectations or needs. This is a tool for exploration, not a definitive solution.

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<br>
Ultimately, I invite you to use this project with an openness to possibilities and an understanding that, like any tool, its real value comes from how it is used.

<b>For questions, clarifications, or feedback, feel free to open a discussion on GitHub or send an email. I'll be more than happy to collaborate and learn together with you.</b>
